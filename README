An agent running on hosts to control virtual machines via libvirt API.

This project, though functions normally and can be extended to be a full 
fledged agent, is not meant be used directly without modifications for it:

- Is just an agent, you have to implement the server part based on the binary 
protocol
- Uses binary protocol for rapid prototyping but not friendly for server 
implementation
